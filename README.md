## Deployment

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> We depend on `Red-Hat Yaml Extension` for validating the values files against the relevant schemas from helm-common.
> That means, you should install the extension from vscode in order to be able to edit values files according to our schemas.

To update helm dependencies
```bash
yarn helm-update
```

In order to create/renew values schemas 
```bash
yarn helm-assets
```

To deploy: helm values **MUST** be combined from global.yaml and values.yaml (use npm script!)
```bash
yarn helm-install
```

See [helm values](https://github.com/MapColonies/helm-common/blob/c352a2453117895ec0f9df0267a66d6f5b9c2da2/README.md)
